# 🧭 Arch-Gateway

## 🔭 Overview

Gateway is an innovative solution built on the Archway platform that bridges the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, enabling the rewarding of web2 actions without compromising web3 decentralization principles. It broadens the scope of Archway's reward system and paves the way for the integration of diverse industries, including AI, gaming, and database sectors, into the decentralized Web 3.0 environment.

Picture a scenario where each node runs the same deterministic JavaScript code, triggered by a transaction, with the results uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain and validated by a smart contract. In this context, the web2 logic represented by JavaScript code is executed and validated without undermining the principles of web3 decentralization.
